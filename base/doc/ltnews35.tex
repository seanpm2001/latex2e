\section{Introduction}


\section{New or improved commands}

\subsection{A kevyal approach to option handling}

The classical \LaTeXe{} method for handling options, using \cs{ProcessOptions},
treats each entry in the list as a string. Many package authors have sought to
extend this handling by treating each entry as a key--value pair (keyval)
instead. To-date, this has required the use of additional packages, for example
\pkg{kvoptions}.

The \LaTeX{} team have for some time offered the package \pkg{l3keys2e} to
allow keyvals defined using the \pkg{expl3} module \pkg{l3keys} to act as
package options. This ability has now been integrated directly into the kernel.
As part of this integration, the syntax for processing keyval options has been
refined, such that
\begin{verbatim}
\ProcessKeyOptions
\end{verbatim}
will now automatically pick up the package name as the key \emph{family}, which
can otherwise be given as an optional argument
\begin{verbatim}
\ProcessKeyOptions[family]
\end{verbatim}
A version which does not consider global options,
\cs{ProcessKeyPackageOptions}, is also available.

To support creating key options in for this mechanism, the new command
\cs{DeclareKeys} has been added. This works using the same general
approach as \pkg{l3keys} or \pkg{pgfkeys}: each key has one or more
\emph{properties} which define its behavior.

Options for packages which use this new approach will not be checked for
clashes by the kernel. Instead, each time a \cs{usepackage} or
\cs{RequirePackage} line is encountered, the list of options given will be
passed to \cs{ProcessKeyPackageOptions}. Options which can only be given
the first time a package is loaded can be marked using the property
\texttt{.usage = load}, and will result in a warning if used in a subsequent
package loading line.

Package options defined in this way can also be set within a package using
the new command \cs{SetKeys}, which again takes an optional argument
to specify the \emph{family}, plus a mandatory one for the options themselves.

\section{Code improvements}


\subsection{Lua\TeX\ callback improvements}

The Lua\TeX\ callbacks \texttt{hpack\_quality} and \texttt{vpack\_quality} are
now \texttt{exclusive} and therefore only allow a single handler.
The previous type \texttt{list} resulted in incorrect parameters when multiple
handlers were set, therefore this only makes an existing restriction more
explicit.

Additionally the return value \texttt{true} for \texttt{list} callbacks is now
handled internally and no longer passed on to the engine. This simplifies the
handling of these callbacks and makes it easier to provide consistent
interfaces for user defined \texttt{list} callbacks.
